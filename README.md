**ChatBot using Python**

This project is a simple chatbot built using Python, machine learning, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to user input based on pre-defined intents.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes user input for better model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: Uses a sequential model with an embedding layer, bidirectional LSTM, and dense layers for classification.
- **Training**: The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and accuracy metrics, with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Response Generation**: Predicts the intent of user queries and selects appropriate responses.
- **Spacy Integration**: Utilizes `spaCy` for natural language processing.
- **Interactive Interface**: Simple command-line interface where users can chat with the bot.

**Usage**:
Clone the repository, ensure the necessary dependencies are installed, and run the `chatbot.ipynb` notebook or Python script to start interacting with the chatbot.

This project is perfect for exploring the basics of machine learning and NLP in chatbot development.
